Fills quadrille cells in several ways: 1. Without value: as a chessboard; or, 2. With `value`: in current empty cells, a specific cell, a designated row, or a group of matching cells using [flood fill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill).

**Observation:** `fill` may be regarded as the sibling of `clear`, filling the quadrille with non-`null` values instead. See [clear]({{< ref "clear" >}}) for details.
